// Explain the concept of the Boolean data type in JavaScript. Provide examples of variables with Boolean values.
// ans:To represent logical values, JavaScript uses the Boolean data type, which has two possible values: true or false. These values often result from comparisons or logical operations. Additionally, the Boolean() function can convert other types of values into Boolean, determining their truthy or falsy nature.
let a = 1000;
let b = 500;
console.log(a > b);
console.log(a < b);
